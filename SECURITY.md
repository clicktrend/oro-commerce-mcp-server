### üìã What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
- **Assessment**: Initial assessment within 72 hours
- **Updates**: Regular updates on investigation progress
- **Resolution**: Security fixes prioritized and released promptly
- **Credit**: Public credit given to reporters (if desired)

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

Our MCP server implements several security best practices:

#### Authentication & Authorization
- **OAuth2 Client Credentials** flow for secure API access
- **Automatic token management** with secure refresh handling
- **No password storage** - uses OAuth2 tokens exclusively
- **Configurable API permissions** in ORO Commerce backend

#### Data Protection  
- **Read-only operations** by default - no data modification capabilities
- **Parameter validation** prevents injection attacks
- **Input sanitization** for all user-provided data
- **No sensitive data logging** - credentials masked in logs

#### Network Security
- **HTTPS enforcement** for all API communications
- **TLS certificate validation** (configurable for development)
- **Request timeout limits** to prevent DoS attacks
- **Rate limiting** through ORO Commerce API limits

#### Code Security
- **TypeScript strict mode** for type safety
- **Input validation** using Zod schemas
- **Error handling** prevents information leakage
- **Dependency scanning** via npm audit

### üîí Security Configuration

#### Production Deployment
```bash
# Use secure environment variables
export ORO_SHOP_URL="https://your-secure-oro.com"
export ORO_CLIENT_ID="your_client_id"
export ORO_CLIENT_SECRET="your_client_secret"
export NODE_ENV="production"

# Disable debug logging in production
unset DEBUG
```

#### ORO Commerce Security Setup
1. **Create dedicated OAuth application** with minimal required permissions
2. **Use Client Credentials flow** (no user passwords involved)
3. **Grant only READ permissions** for required entities
4. **Regularly rotate OAuth credentials**
5. **Monitor API access logs** in ORO Commerce

#### Recommended Permissions
```
Minimum required permissions:
- Accounts: Read
- B2B Customers: Read  
- Orders: Read (optional)
- Products: Read (optional)

NOT recommended:
- Write/Update permissions
- Delete permissions
- Administrative access
```

### üö® Security Considerations

#### Environment Variables
- **Never commit `.env` files** to version control
- **Use secure credential management** in production
- **Rotate credentials regularly**
- **Limit access** to environment configuration

#### API Access
- **Review ORO Commerce logs** regularly for unusual access patterns
- **Monitor API usage** for unexpected volume or patterns
- **Implement IP restrictions** if possible in ORO Commerce
- **Use dedicated service accounts** rather than personal accounts

#### Network Deployment
- **Deploy behind firewalls** when possible
- **Use VPN connections** for sensitive environments
- **Limit network access** to required ports and protocols
- **Regular security updates** for hosting infrastructure

### üîç Security Auditing

#### Regular Security Checks
```bash
# Check for vulnerable dependencies
npm audit

# Update dependencies
npm update

# Verify build integrity
npm run build

# Test authentication
npm start # Then test connection
```

#### Monitoring Recommendations
- **Log all API requests** (without sensitive data)
- **Monitor authentication failures**
- **Track unusual usage patterns**
- **Set up alerts** for security events

### üõ†Ô∏è Security Development Practices

#### Code Review Process
- **All code changes** require review
- **Security-focused reviews** for authentication/authorization changes
- **Dependency updates** reviewed for security implications
- **Automated security scanning** in CI/CD pipeline

#### Secure Coding Guidelines
- **Input validation** for all external data
- **Error handling** without information disclosure
- **Logging** without sensitive data exposure
- **Authentication** verification for all API calls
